This is a prototype for LittleBrother, an ubuntu linux based desktop application for managing security cameras. All rights to the code belong to Jacob Hunter "Kobi" Tessman: jtessman@mail.csuchico.edu. But since this is a private repository, I'm assuming you're either a professor or a friend of mine anyway.

This program was make with opencv 3.1.0, opengl, and cmake. Google what libraries are needed for each if you run into any compilation errors.

cd LittleBrother/opencv
cmake -WITH_OPENGL=ON .
make
