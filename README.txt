This is a prototype for LittleBrother, an ubuntu linux based desktop application for managing security cameras. All rights to the code belong to Jacob Hunter "Kobi" Tessman: jtessman@mail.csuchico.edu. But since this is a private repository, I'm assuming you're either a professor or a friend of mine anyway.

This program requires the following libraries:

python3-pil
python3-pil.imagetk
python3-tk

and is assuming that you are running it with python 3.
